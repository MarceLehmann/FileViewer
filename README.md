# FileViewer

Preparation:
As seen in the GIF 'SP PIC-Column', create a hyperlink column, then switch it to a picture column and add the URL of an image file.
This has to be done only once so that we get the correct storage.

CanvasApp:
Import the component and edit it as described in the Component Inputs comments. To get the SP Datastorage out, you can look at this in the GIF 'SP FileStorage'.
